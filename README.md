# <Ultimate Coding Quiz>

## Description

I created this project to make a learning experience interactive and fun. On this project you are able to play a quick quiz game and record your score and test your knowledge in coding. The best thing I learnt from this was the power of Javascript and its abilities. I struggled a lot trying to write Javascript functions but learnt to write up elements dynamically through Jasvascript.

## Usage
